    "Healthy": "A healthy jackfruit typically exhibits a vibrant green to yellowish-green rind, depending on its ripeness, covered in firm, well-defined cone-like spikes. The surface should be largely uniform, free from deep cuts, extensive bruising, soft or sunken decaying spots, visible mold, or clear signs of insect entry/damage.",
    "Rhizopus_rot": "Rhizopus rot, caused by the fungal pathogen Rhizopus stolonifer, is a common disease of jackfruit, especially in high rainfall areas. It manifests as soft, brown spots on fruits and flowers, often progressing to a fuzzy, black, rotten, and sometimes mummified fruit appearance. The disease can cause significant fruit loss and is favored by warm, rainy conditions.",
    "Fruit_fly": "Infestation by fruit flies is a major cause of damage and rot in jackfruit. Adult female fruit flies puncture the skin of ripening or mature jackfruit to lay their eggs inside. Fruit fly damage renders the affected parts of the jackfruit inedible and unmarketable. Severe infestations can lead to premature fruit drop and significant crop loss. ",
    "Fruit_borer": "Fruit fly damage in jackfruit is caused by the larvae of fruit flies (commonly Bactrocera dorsalis), which burrow into the fruit to feed. This results in soft, discolored, and rotting patches, often with small puncture holes where eggs were laid. Affected fruits may become deformed, drop prematurely, or rot internally, reducing both market quality and yield."
